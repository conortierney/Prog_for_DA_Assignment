# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment - 2023  

### Author: Conor Tierney

**This repositiory contains a README, a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook.**

-------------------------------

This notebook was created to model and synthesise data using Python for my Programming for Data Analysis Assignment as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU. It details my research of a real-world phenomenon and its analysis via Python packages and modules. The notebook investigates the types of variables in the data set, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

When the code is run within the Jupyter notebook it ouputs arrays, plots, histograms and data summaries for visualization and analysis of the data set.

My simulated data set is based of a data set related to FIFA Football Players from SoFifa.com.

Sofifa.com is a website providing information and statistics related to the FIFA video game series developed by EA Sports. The website focuses on the virtual representations of 17,000 real-world football players' attributes. It details a wide array of player-specific data points, including players ages,height, weight, clubs, and various performance and skill ratings. These ratings are often based on the players' real-life performances.

## Steps to complete the project  

My approach to completing this assignment was to break it down into small parts to keep structure, research an existing data set and to base my project on some elements of that data set. My code, analysis and descriptions were based off what I have already learned in this module along with some internet research, python packages and analysis resources which are well referenced at the end of this notebook.  

**I reviewed the original dataset and generated a program using Python **numpy.random** package for this purpose.**  

1. Search and research an existing data set that I am interested in.  
2. Investigate the types of variables involved in the data set & choose what elements I will simulate.
3. Analyse the distributions of those variables to replicate in my generated data set
4. Import Python libraries needed to run my code. 
5. Review and describe the variable categories.
6. Generate random data set with numpy.random package.   
7. Plot the varibale distributions.  
8. Analyse the data frame.  
9. Visualise the data set summary.
